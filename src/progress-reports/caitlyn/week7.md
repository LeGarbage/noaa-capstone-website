At the time of writing this we are OFFICIALLY done with **Milestone 2!!!** Also Caitlyn is still losing half a day of development for Cornerstone until the end of next semester (I finally figured that one out)

## Work Completed this Week

Since I was gone for two days this week and Friday was kind of a chill day, the two days I was actually here I started working through the ThreeJS course Rudy gave me to learn the ropes! It’s a crazy long course and I’m never expecting myself to get through it, but it’s good for foundational basics and will help when we start to finally develop in **Milestone 3!**

## Challenges Encountered

Nothing of note :D

## Goals for the Coming Week

Next week is Thanksgiving Break! A week away from any possible burn out. I would like to maybe think of an idea for what the visualization might look like, but really I’m going to try my best to do literally NO work.
