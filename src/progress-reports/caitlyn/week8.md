At the time of writing this we are OFFICIALLY done with **Milestone 2!!!** Also Caitlyn is still losing half a day of development for Cornerstone until the end of next semester (I finally figured that one out)

## Work Completed this Week

It’s a very awkward period of time coming out of a week long break and there’s another big break ahead of us. As such, we’re made the choice to halt all production until the start of next semester. Even them, I’m still learning ThreeJS, React and JSX little by little. It will be a lot easier once we start real production and I’m learning all of it in real time.

## Challenges Encountered

Nothing of note :D

## Goals for the Coming Week

Next week is the last week of the semester! Since we’re not making any real progress until January there’s no real goals. Just got to keep reviewing code and documentation and working through the examples in the **ThreeJS Journey** course :D
