All progress reports will be completed by Caitlyn and Logan from here on out.

At the time of writing this we are still ahead of schedule by about a month— though some of the extra time was lost to Middle School Tours this past week. We anticipated that our infrastructure would take until October 31st, but as it stands both of us are making decent progress through **Milestone 2** which can be basically summarized into data reprocessing and basic front end visualization.

Do note Caitlyn loses half a day worth of development on Thursdays due to Cornerstone from now until the end of the semester— Roughly December 11, 2025— but not this week :)

## Work Completed this Week

**From Logan:** I completed the capstone website. Due to middle schools tours, most of my time was spent on that.

**From Caitlyn:** Although middle school tours were happening, I still tried to complete work for **Milestone 2** and I’m happy to report it’s basically done for now. I completed Pytests for the methods I’ve been writing. They need to under go a personal code review for documentation before Rudy reviews it and we update the package. Though, of course, since the tours happened work was minimal but still productive either way.

## Challenges Encountered

Middle school tours. That’s all that needs to be said with that :3 Other than that our slack trial has officially ended. To combat that we’re making a more conscious effort to track progress inside of our GitHub issues instead. We can track the problems we faced, the help Rudy provided, and the ultimate outcome better that way.

**From Caitlyn:** As resampling progress continues I’ve been thinking about how I’ll be testing my code as we move closer to the ultimate goal. For the past week I’ve been testing on a store that’s only about 10GB but of course, in the end we’ll be testing with a much larger scale. The lab computers don’t nearly have enough space or processing power. I suspect this won’t be a problem for a while, but it looms in the back of my head.

## Goals for the Coming Week

**From Logan:** Do literally anything on the actual capstone.

**From Caitlyn:** We have a meeting set up at noon on Tuesday with Rudy. I’m hoping to set up some more goals to work towards with the rest of the resampling, but I can confidently say I’m about ~50% of the way done with it! On my end at least. I plan to code review my tests right after the meeting and continue pressing on with development. If Logan needs help I would be open to helping him on his front as well.
