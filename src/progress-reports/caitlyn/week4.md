At the time of writing this we are still ahead of schedule by about a month, maybe even two! We anticipated that our infrastructure would take until October 31st, but as it stands both of us are making decent progress through **Milestone 2** which can be basically summarized into data reprocessing and basic front end visualization.

A meeting with Rudy on October 14, 2025 confirmed that I’m on track to actually finish **Milestone 2** by **Thanksgiving Break (~November 21)** if not sooner!

Do note Caitlyn loses half a day worth of development on Thursdays due to Cornerstone from now until the end of the semester— Roughly December 11, 2025— I think. I’m not actually sure when Cornerstone ends :D

## Work Completed this Week

Work was quite minimal this week due to all the Evil Week stuff and recovering from crimpling burnout (just kidding), but there wasn’t too much done. I finished the base concept of the tree resampling as well as did some housekeeping in the package (removing packages that aren’t in use anymore). I also started reworking all the functions to work more efficiently to produce the tree we want.

## Challenges Encountered

Not much has changed between this week and last week. There’s a slow work flow going, but really it’s nothing that we can control.

The tail end of **Milestone 2** is taking a bit longer than we might’ve been anticipated. That’s partially due to the new and very abstract concept that is resampling a tree the correct way, but also because of the activities in class for Evil Week. There’s still a flow of production being done in very small increments. Along with that, trees take about 12 minutes to resample which amounts to a very very long time after constant testing. Rudy has said that’s normal, but to help with it I’ve added a new parameter that will use x% of the store instead of 100% of it.

## Goals for the Coming Week

Finish the resampling! I’m very very close to completing the full tree resampling. Just need to polish a few lines, tweak how things are being done and then all of that combined should result in a resampled tree.

- [x]  Make a DataTree Data Set
- [ ]  Resample each Data Set on each level of the DataTree

One issue a week is the goal work flow :) Seems like we’re hitting one goal for half a week though.
