At the time of writing this we are still ahead of schedule by about a month, maybe even two! We anticipated that our infrastructure would take until October 31st, but as it stands both of us are making decent progress through **Milestone 2** which can be basically summarized into data reprocessing and basic front end visualization.

A meeting with Rudy on October 14, 2025 confirmed that I’m on track to actually finish **Milestone 2** by **Thanksgiving Break (~November 21)** if not sooner!

Do note Caitlyn loses half a day worth of development on Thursdays due to Cornerstone from now until the end of the semester— Roughly December 11, 2025— I think. I’m not actually sure when Cornerstone ends :D

## Work Completed this Week

**Milestone 2** is finally done!!! After about 40 hours of waiting for tests to run, we can finally resample a store in the way we want— for the most part. There are a few bugs to fix but Rudy wants to save that for when the project becomes open source as me and Logan have some more important things. The main bug in question would be the tree resampling taking up too much memory. I might revisit that later on in the year if I have some time, but for now it’s just more of an *improvement.*

## Challenges Encountered

think the only thing that was a real challenge was having to wait for tests on Rudy’s end to finish. One resampling of a rather large (100+ GB) store took about 20 hours to do. Most of that comes down to the resampling and perhaps with the memory improvement in the future it might be better. There’s nothing we can do about it except accept it for now. I don’t think it’ll be that big of an issue as the main store we’re working with is resampled!

## Goals for the Coming Week

I think next week will focus on learning ThreeJS! It’s not too clear where development will go, but a lot of development will pick up in December (after Thanksgiving Break) when we set some milestone goals and Logan isn’t dying (his wisdom teeth are no more).
