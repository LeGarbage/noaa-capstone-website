Also Caitlyn is still losing half a day of development for Cornerstone until the end of this semester (I finally figured that one out)

## Work Completed this Week

Well well well. Work completed this week... minimal progress which sounds terrible, but we're at the point where it's a bunch of trouble shoot and debugging (continued below).

## Challenges Encountered

So there's a lot of challenges. There's too many fetching requests, it's buggy, it's laggy, all of it. For the debugging, it can feel like we fix one thing and then three other things fix but I feel that we're on the verge of getting past that. Personally, I've been able to get dynamic loading to work and now I'm focusing on fixing the 404 errors that occur that fail the texture loading. I think if that works then most of the issues are fixed and we can move onto loading additonal layers of the tree.

## Goals for the Coming Week

Hopefully, this next week we can get a break through. I'll be fighting hard against the 404 errors to resolve them and finally get some kind of working dynamic loading. I swear we can't have both. It's literally one or the other at this point, but I'm determined to make it work.
