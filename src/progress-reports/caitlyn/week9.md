At the time of writing this we are officially moving on to **Milestone 3!** Also Caitlyn is still losing half a day of development for Cornerstone until the end of next semester (I finally figured that one out)

## Work Completed this Week

I managed to get color schemes to work for our visualization. They're interchangeable within the code, but it's not very efficient to change the color scheme. The original EchoFish used "virdis" but I've chosen to use "turbo" as the colors are little bit more distinctive and visible. Of course, we may choose to change that for our final product.

Aside from that, the fish box is offically no more as we're finally loading real data! There's no zoom yet and it's not dynamic yet (read below).

## Challenges Encountered

This is more a Logan problem, since he's working mainly on this while I toil away with Cornerstone, but while the data might be loading and displaying correctly, it's just not... right yet. It's not dynamically loading and it can be laggy at times due ot it fetching things that don't exist (for whatever reason). It seems like he's tried a lot of things, but the worst case scenario for this is we pass off what we have to Rudy to see if he can fix it :(

## Goals for the Coming Week

With the coming weeks hopefully we can fix whatever is happening with the loading and move onto getting the zoom working. The zoom is technically the last main component of what we have to include in the capstone since NOAA can then take that and expand on it. If we can get that done soon then we'll basically be done! I have a feeling I will be dedicating a big chunk on my time on software development for Cornerstone too so we will have to see what is actually completed!
