At the time of writing this we are still ahead of schedule by about a month, maybe even two! We anticipated that our infrastructure would take until October 31st, but as it stands both of us are making decent progress through **Milestone 2** which can be basically summarized into data reprocessing and basic front end visualization.

A meeting with Rudy on October 14, 2025 confirmed that I’m on track to actually finish **Milestone 2** by **Thanksgiving Break (~November 21)** if not sooner!

Do note Caitlyn loses half a day worth of development on Thursdays due to Cornerstone from now until the end of the semester— Roughly December 11, 2025— I think. I’m not actually sure when Cornerstone ends :D

## Work Completed this Week

**Milestone 2** is finally seeing it’s end. I managed to restructure the whole DataTree to resample properly and now we’re just testing and debugging! I also did a lot of housekeeping: Test writing, cleaning comments, function headers, etc

## Challenges Encountered

Not much has changed between this week and last week. There’s a slow work flow going, but really it’s nothing that we can control. There’s a lot of small little details that can cause the whole code to fail but it’s nothing super serious. It’s just a whole lot of attention to detail and debugging.

## Goals for the Coming Week

Finish the resampling! I’m very very close to completing the full tree resampling. Just need to polish a few lines, tweak how things are being done and then all of that combined should result in a resampled tree.
