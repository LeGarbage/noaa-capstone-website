* Work Completed
  Milestone 2 is done! Although the thunk implementation took much longer
  than I initially expected, I did meet last week's goal and was actually
  able to successfully fetch some data from the S3 bucket and get the store's
  shape to display on screen. This is huge because it means that all of the
  backend stuff is finished and, apart from adding various fetchers for any
  properties in the future, we can focus exclusively on the UI and UX from
  now on, which will likely take us the rest of the capstone.

  I also took a little time to document all of the backend APIs so it should
  be trivial to add more in the future as needed.

* Next week
  I'm not planning on doing anything over break, but in the weeks between
  Thanksgiving and Christmas I hope to have at least some data actually
  rendered visually, even if it's just a visual representation of the store's
  shape.
