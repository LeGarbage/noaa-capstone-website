                <p class="text">
                    Water column sonar is an acoustic backscatter from the water’s surface to
                    the seafloor which is used to assess physical and biological characteristics of the
                    ocean. With this data scientists determine the spatio-temporal distributions of different
                    marine life including many species of fish.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text">
                    Currently scientists use expensive and proprietary software to visualize the water
                    column. Open source efforts such as echofish (shown above) are being developed to
                    allow users access to these datasets but those efforts fall short, only enabling small
                    glimpses of the data spanning a couple hours at most.

                <p class="text">
                    The goal of this project is to take these large cruises observing months of data at a time
                    and allow users to more seamlessly visualize them at scale. The intuition that someone
                    has when I hand them a phone with a picture on it is that they can hold the phone and
                    zoom in and out to get a better understanding of the content — water column sonar
                    data needs to break free from the constraint of its size so users can follow that same
                    intuition. Using modern tools in the browser will allow users to quickly download small
                    subsets of the data while still having access to that comprehensive view.

                <p class="text">
                    Environmental impacts and sustainability are the central focus of this project. Being able
                    to analyze and visualize the data at scale gives researchers the tools to understand
                    patterns and develop models. Understanding characteristics of the marine biome
                    enables scientists to more accurately estimate fish population and characterize
                    behavior, this has a direct impact preventing the collapse of keystone species who have
                    historically been prone to overfishing throughout the world&#39;s oceans. The fisheries
                    scientists who look at this data ultimately use it to determine things like which species
                    are added to the Marine Mammal Protections Act or the Endangered Species Act,
                    which in turn can protect marine wildlife in critical habitats.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text">
                    We can also start to model this data alongside meteorological observations which
                    reveals confounding effects associated with climate change. Being able to access
                    decades of data helps us understand that environmental impact over time.

                <p class="text">
                    And finally, consolidated visualizations of cruise data creates a canvas where deep
                    learning models can begin to inform users which regions are of the most interest.
                    Working with researchers at CU Boulder, we are beginning to add semantic layers to
                    these datasets and enrich the visualization process but the derived data suffers from the
                    same visualization challenges — the data is too big to look at. We need ways to more
                    intuitively navigate this process to unleash its full utility.
